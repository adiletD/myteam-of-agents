# Project Idea: Educational Snake Game for Kids

## Problem Statement
Kids need engaging ways to learn while having fun. Traditional educational games can feel too "school-like," while pure entertainment games don't provide learning value. Parents and teachers want games that balance both.

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Kids (age range TBD - to be refined during development)
- **Secondary**: Parents/teachers looking for educational gaming options

## Core Value Proposition
A snake game that combines classic, simple gameplay with educational elements - making learning feel like play rather than work.

## Key Features (To Be Defined)
- Classic snake mechanics (simple, intuitive controls)
- Educational component (TBD: could be math, letters, problem-solving, etc.)
- Kid-friendly design and difficulty

## Success Metrics
- Kids choose to play it repeatedly
- Evidence of learning (specific metrics TBD)
- Positive feedback from parents/teachers

## MVP Scope
**Build in first iteration:**
- Basic snake game mechanics
- Simple educational twist (pick ONE thing to teach)
- Colorful, kid-friendly graphics
- Works in browser (easy to share)

**Figure out later:**
- Specific age targeting
- Exact learning objectives
- Progression/levels
- Parent dashboard

## Open Questions to Explore
1. What specific age range should we focus on?
2. What EXACTLY should kids learn? (Pick ONE for MVP)
3. How will we get feedback from real kids/parents?
4. What makes this better than existing options?

## Next Steps
- Start building basic prototype
- Test with real kids to refine the educational component
- Iterate based on actual user feedback

**Status**: Ready to prototype 🚀  
**Note**: This idea will evolve through building and user testing. Start simple, learn fast.
