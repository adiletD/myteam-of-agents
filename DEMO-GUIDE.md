# 🎬 Quick Demo Guide

## The 5-Agent Team

```
💡 Idea Agent          → Validates ideas
🔍 Market Research     → Analyzes competition
📋 Product Manager     → Creates development plan
💻 Software Engineer   → Builds full-stack app
🐛 QA Engineer         → Tests & ensures quality
```

## Simple 20-Minute Flow

### Step 1: Validate Idea (3 min)
```
@idea-agent
I want to build a snake game where the snake changes emotions 
based on what it eats (angry/red, chill/rainbow, hyper/chaotic)
```

**Expected**: Agent asks validation questions, outputs idea document

---

### Step 2: Research Market (3 min)
```
@market-research
Research competitors for an emotion-based snake game. 
What exists and what's missing?
```

**Expected**: Competitive analysis showing market gap

---

### Step 3: Create Plan (3 min)
```
@product-manager
Based on the validated idea and market research, create a 
Product Requirements Document with:
- User stories
- Feature breakdown
- Technical requirements
```

**Expected**: PRD with clear development tasks

---

### Step 4: Build the App (8-10 min)
```
@software-engineer
Build the Emotion Snake game based on the PRD:

Backend (TypeScript):
- Snake movement & collision detection
- Food spawning (3 types: angry, chill, hyper)
- Emotion state management
- Score system

Frontend (React):
- Canvas game board (600x600)
- Emotion-based colors & particle effects
- Score display
- Modern, vibrant design
- Responsive controls

Make it fully functional and visually appealing!
```

**Expected**: Complete working game with backend logic + frontend UI

---

### Step 5: Test & Polish (3 min)
```
@qa-engineer
Test the complete Emotion Snake game:
1. Test all emotion modes
2. Check collision detection
3. Find edge cases and bugs
4. Improve user experience
5. Add any missing polish

Fix critical issues!
```

**Expected**: Bug fixes, improvements, polished experience

---

### Step 6: Audience Participation (2-3 min)
```
@software-engineer
[Take audience suggestion]
Example: "Add a rainbow trail when in chill mode"
```

**Expected**: Live feature implementation!
